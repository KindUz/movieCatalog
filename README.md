# movieCatalog

#### beta url - https://kinduz.github.io/movieCatalog/

This project was made to consolidate work with the API. The site is made on native js, without the use of additional libraries and frameworks.

This project uses the unofficial API of Kinopoisk - https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/

On the site you can:
<ul> 
  <li>Search for movies, anime, TV series, etc. by keywords (by genre, by name)</li>
  <li>View detailed information about this movie when you click</li>
  <li>Switch between movie pages (pagination)</li>
</ul>
